<b>PS:</b> Explain what the following code is attempting to do? You can explain by: </br>

- 1 ) Explaining how the highlighted constructs work?
- 2 ) Giving use-cases of what these constructs could be used for.
- 3 ) What is the significance of the for loop with 4 iterations?
- 4 ) What is the significance of make(chan func(), 10)?
- 5 ) Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?
  </br>
  Code :

```
package main
import "fmt";

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```

<b>Solution:</b>

- declares that the code is part of the `main` package, and it is the entry point for the executable programs.

```
package main
```

- This line imports the fmt package, which provides functions for formatting and printing output. It is commonly used for printing messages to the console.

```
import "fmt";
```

- `main` function, which is the entry point for the executable program.

```
func main()
```

- Creates a buffered channel named `cnp` of type `chan func()` with a buffer size of 10. This channel is capable of holding up to 10 functions. Channels are used for communication and synchronization between goroutines in Go.

```
cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
```

- `for` loop that will run four times. The loop will be used to launch four goroutines.

```
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++
```

- anonymous function (a closure) and launches it as a goroutine using the `go` keyword. Each iteration of the loop will create a new goroutine.

```
go func()
```

- Inner `for` loop that continuously receives functions from the `cnp `channel. The loop will iterate as long as there are functions in the channel. The `range` keyword is used with channels to iterate over values until the channel is closed.

```
for f := range cnp
```

- Executes the function f received from the channel

```
f()
```

- Sends a function literal to the cnp channel. The function literal prints "HERE1" using fmt.Println. The channel is buffered, so it won't block the sender even though there are no goroutines currently receiving.

```
cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
```

- prints "Hello" in the main goroutine.

```
 fmt.Println("Hello")
```
